# üéØ Payment Setup Fix - Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing `/api/payments` Endpoint**
**Problem:** The submit page was calling `/api/payments` endpoint that didn't exist, causing "payment setup failed" error.

**Solution:** Created `/app/api/payments/route.js` with:
- `POST /api/payments` - Creates Lemon Squeezy checkout session
- `GET /api/payments` - Checks payment status and retrieves payment history
- Proper authentication and validation
- Integration with LemonSqueezy SDK

### 2. **Incorrect Premium Submission Flow**
**Problem:** Premium submissions were trying to create a placeholder directory with invalid data (hardcoded launch week).

**Solution:** Updated the flow in `/app/submit/page.js`:

**OLD FLOW (Broken):**
1. User selects premium plan
2. ‚ùå Creates placeholder directory with hardcoded data
3. ‚ùå Redirects to payment
4. User completes form after payment

**NEW FLOW (Fixed):**
1. User selects premium plan
2. ‚úÖ User fills in ALL directory information (Steps 2 & 3)
3. ‚úÖ User clicks "Proceed to Payment ($15)" at final step
4. ‚úÖ Directory is created with complete data
5. ‚úÖ Payment checkout is created
6. ‚úÖ User completes payment
7. ‚úÖ Webhook updates payment status automatically
8. ‚úÖ User is redirected to dashboard

## üìÅ Files Modified

- ‚ú® `/app/api/payments/route.js` - Payment API endpoint

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### For Premium Submissions:

2. **Step 2 - Directory Information**
   - User fills in all required fields:
     - Project name, website URL, description
     - Contact email, categories, logo, screenshots
     - All fields validated before proceeding

3. **Step 3 - Launch Week Selection**
   - User selects available launch week
   - Slot availability checked

4. **Final Step - Payment**

5. **After Payment**
   - LemonSqueezy sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
   - Directory payment status is updated automatically

   - Clean redirect to dashboard

### For Standard Submissions:

1. **Step 1-3** - Same as premium (except $0 price)

üéâ LemonSqueezy payment processed successfully!
```

## üîç Environment Variables Required

LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=212773
LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID=1032348
LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production URL
```

## üìä Database Changes

After successful payment, the directory record will have:

```javascript
{
  // ... other fields ...
  plan: "premium",
  payment_status: "paid",  // Updated by webhook
  payment_date: Date,      // When payment was made
  order_id: "...",         // LemonSqueezy order ID
  lemonsqueezy_order_id: "...",  // LemonSqueezy identifier
  payment_amount: 15,
  payment_currency: "USD",
  checkout_session_id: "...",  // Checkout session reference
}
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Payment Flow is Synchronous Now**
   - Directory created ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Webhook updates status
   - User doesn't need to "complete" form after payment
   - Much simpler and more reliable

2. **No More Lost Data**
   - All directory information collected before payment
   - No risk of payment completing but form not submitted

3. **Better Security**
   - Proper authentication checks at each step
   - Directory ownership verified before payment
   - Webhook signature verification

4. **Webhook Required**
   - Payment status is updated via webhook only
   - Make sure webhook URL is configured in LemonSqueezy dashboard
   - Test webhook using `pnpm webhook:simulate`

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow in development
2. Verify webhook processing works
3. Test with real payment in test mode
4. Deploy to production
5. Update webhook URL in LemonSqueezy dashboard
6. Monitor logs for any issues
