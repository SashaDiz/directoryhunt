# Premium Payment Flow - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Columns
**Problem:** The `apps` table was missing payment-tracking columns that the payment API tried to update.

**Error Message:**
```
Update failed: Could not find the 'checkout_session_id' column of 'apps' in the schema cache
```

**Solution:** Added missing columns via database migration:
- `checkout_session_id` (TEXT) - LemonSqueezy checkout session ID
- `payment_initiated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When payment checkout was initiated
- `order_id` (TEXT) - LemonSqueezy order ID after successful payment
- `payment_date` (TIMESTAMP) - When payment was completed

**Migration:** `add_payment_columns_to_apps`

### 2. Incorrect Field Names in Webhook Handler
**Problem:** The webhook handler was using wrong field names when querying the database.

**Fixed Issues:**
- Changed `user_id` to `submitted_by` when looking up directories (apps table uses `submitted_by`)
- Changed `payment_status: "paid"` to `payment_status: true` (boolean field, not string)
- Removed non-existent fields (`lemonsqueezy_order_id`, `payment_amount`, `payment_currency`) from update

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.js`

## Complete Premium Payment Flow

### Step 1: User Submits Premium Directory
1. User fills out form on `/submit` page
2. User selects "Premium" plan
3. Form data is submitted to `/api/directories` (POST)
4. Directory is created with:
   - `plan: "premium"`
   - `payment_status: false`
   - `status: "pending"`
   - `approved: false`

### Step 2: Payment Checkout Creation
1. Frontend receives `directoryId` from directory creation
2. Frontend calls `/api/payments` (POST) with:
   - `planType: "premium"`
   - `directoryId`
   - `directoryData` (name, slug, etc.)
   - `customerEmail`
3. Backend updates directory with:
   - `checkout_session_id` (from LemonSqueezy)
   - `payment_initiated_at` (current timestamp)
4. Backend returns checkout URL
5. Frontend opens checkout URL in new window

### Step 3: User Completes Payment
1. User completes payment on LemonSqueezy checkout page
2. LemonSqueezy sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
3. Webhook handler:
   - Verifies signature
   - Finds directory by slug and user ID
   - Updates directory:
     - `payment_status: true`
     - `payment_date: <timestamp>`
     - `order_id: <lemonsqueezy_order_id>`
   - Creates payment record in `payments` table

### Step 4: Post-Payment Flow
1. Frontend polls payment status
2. Once payment confirmed, user is redirected to dashboard
3. Admin reviews and approves the directory
4. Directory goes live with premium features

## Premium Features Enabled After Payment

Based on the schema and codebase:
- ✅ `premium_badge: true` - Premium badge displayed
- ✅ `skip_queue: true` - Faster review process
- ✅ `social_promotion: true` - Social media promotion
- ✅ `guaranteed_backlinks: 3` - Three guaranteed dofollow backlinks
- ✅ Priority listing placement
- ✅ Detailed analytics access

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# LemonSqueezy Configuration
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=212773
LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID=1032348
LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# Alternative legacy names (supported for backwards compatibility)
LS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LS_STORE_ID=212773
LS_VARIANT_ID=1032348
LS_SIGNING_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# App Configuration

```

## Testing the Flow

### Test Mode Payment
1. Navigate to `/submit`
2. Fill out directory information
3. Select "Premium" plan
4. Complete all form steps
5. Click "Submit" to trigger payment
6. Use LemonSqueezy test card in checkout
7. Complete payment
8. Verify webhook is received and processed
9. Check directory is updated with payment info

### Verify Database Updates
```sql
-- Check directory was created with payment info
SELECT 
  id, name, slug, plan, 
  payment_status, checkout_session_id, 
  payment_date, order_id
FROM apps 
WHERE id = 'your_directory_id';

-- Check payment record was created
SELECT 
  id, user_id, app_id, plan, 
  amount, status, paid_at
FROM payments 
WHERE app_id = 'your_directory_id';
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Set Production Environment Variables**
   - Update `.env.local` with production LemonSqueezy credentials
   - Remove test mode settings

2. **Configure Webhook in LemonSqueezy Dashboard**
   - URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
   - Events: `order_created`, `order_refunded`
   - Copy signing secret to `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. **Test End-to-End in Production**
   - Complete a real payment
   - Verify webhook delivery
   - Confirm directory updates
   - Test all premium features

4. **Monitor and Logging**
   - Review webhook logs in LemonSqueezy dashboard
   - Monitor application logs for payment errors
   - Set up alerts for failed payments

## Files Modified

1. **Database Schema**
   - Migration: `add_payment_columns_to_apps`
   - Added: `checkout_session_id`, `payment_initiated_at`, `order_id`, `payment_date`

2. **Backend Routes**
   - `/app/api/payments/route.js` - No changes needed (already correct)
   - `/app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.js` - Fixed field names

3. **Libraries**
   - `/app/libs/lemonsqueezy.js` - No changes needed (already correct)

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Checkout session creation failed"**
   - Verify `LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID` is set correctly
   - Check `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` is valid
   - Ensure store ID matches your LemonSqueezy account

2. **"Webhook signature verification failed"**
   - Verify `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches dashboard
   - Check webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Ensure webhook payload is not modified by middleware

3. **"Directory not found in webhook"**
   - Verify custom data is being passed to checkout
   - Check directory was created before payment
   - Ensure user_id matches authenticated user

### Debug Logging

The payment flow has extensive logging. Check server console for:
- `✅ Checkout session created successfully`
- `✅ Webhook signature verified successfully`
- `✅ Directory found by slug`
- `✅ Directory updated successfully`
- `✅ Payment recorded successfully`
