  - High authority backlink for top 3 winners
  - 15 shared weekly slots
  - Community voting access

**Note**: Both plans can earn badges for top 3 ranking products regardless of the chosen plan.

### Slot System

The platform uses a shared slot system:
- **Slots 1-15**: Shared between Standard and Premium submissions
- **Slots 16-25**: Premium-only (available when shared slots fill up)
- Standard submissions are blocked when `total_submissions >= 15`
- Premium submissions are blocked when `total_submissions >= 25`

### Draft System

Premium submissions are automatically saved as drafts until payment is confirmed:

- **Draft Creation**: When a user selects Premium but doesn't complete payment, their submission is saved as a draft
- **Resume Drafts**: Users can resume drafts from their dashboard, modify details, or even switch to Standard plan
- **Auto-Cleanup**: If a user resubmits with the same name/URL, unpaid drafts are automatically replaced
- **No Slot Blocking**: Drafts don't count toward weekly slot limits until payment is confirmed

**Draft States:**
- `status: "draft"` - Unpaid premium submission
- `is_draft: true` - Flag for easy filtering
- `payment_status: false` - Not yet paid
- `scheduled_launch: false` - Not scheduled until payment

After successful payment, drafts are automatically converted to active submissions.

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture

This application implements **defense-in-depth security** with three layers of protection:

1. **Client-Side Protection**
   - Submit page redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
   - Preserves redirect URL for seamless return after login
   - Improves UX by preventing unnecessary API calls

2. **API-Level Authentication**
   - All protected endpoints validate Supabase session
   - Returns 401 Unauthorized for invalid requests
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

3. **Database Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - PostgreSQL RLS policies enforce data access rules
   - Users can only submit/update their own projects
   - Users can only vote once per project
   - Cannot be bypassed from application code

### Authenticated Actions

✅ **Authenticated users can:**
- Submit AI projects to launches (FREE or Premium)
- Vote for projects
- Update their own submissions
- View their dashboard

❌ **Unauthenticated users:**
- Are redirected to sign-in when accessing protected pages
- Receive 401 errors when accessing protected APIs
- Cannot bypass security via database RLS policies

### Testing Authentication

Test authentication by:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign in"
3. Try any authentication method (Email or Google)
4. Verify you're signed in (avatar appears in header)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- Supabase project with schema deployed
- Lemon Squeezy account with products configured
- All environment variables ready

#### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

3. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Environment Variables BEFORE deploying**
   
   In Vercel, go to Settings → Environment Variables and add:
   
   **Required Supabase Variables** (Get from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API):
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Your anon/public key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = Your service role key (⚠️ Keep secret!)
   
   **Required Lemon Squeezy Variables** (Get from: Lemon Squeezy → Settings → API):
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` = Your API key
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID` = Your store ID (numeric)
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = Your webhook signing secret
   - `LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID` = Your premium plan variant ID (numeric)
   
   **Required Email Variables** (Get from: Resend → API Keys):
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = Your Resend API key for email notifications
   
   **Required Supabase S3 Variables** (Get from: Supabase → Settings → Storage):
   - `SUPABASE_S3_ENDPOINT` = Your S3 endpoint URL
   - `SUPABASE_S3_REGION` = Your S3 region (usually us-east-1)
   - `SUPABASE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = Your S3 access key ID
   - `SUPABASE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = Your S3 secret access key
   - `SUPABASE_S3_BUCKET` = Your storage bucket name (logos)
   
   **Required App Variables:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://yourdomain.com`
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Set all variables for Production, Preview, AND Development environments!

4. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy
   - Build should complete without errors if all env vars are set

5. **Post-Deployment Configuration**
   
   **a) Update Supabase Authentication Settings:**
   
   Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:
   
   - **Site URL**: Set to `https://yourdomain.com`
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add these URLs (click "Add URL" for each):
     ```
     https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback
     https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback/**
     https://yourdomain.com/**
     ```
   - Click **Save** after adding each URL
   
   ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This prevents authentication from redirecting to localhost in production!
   
   **b) Update Lemon Squeezy Webhook:**
   
   - Go to Lemon Squeezy → Settings → Webhooks
   - Update endpoint URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
   
   **c) Update OAuth Apps (if using Google):**
   
   For **Google OAuth**:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   

### Deployment Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "Missing Supabase environment variables":**
- ✅ Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in Vercel
- ✅ Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- ✅ Ensure no extra spaces in values

**Auth redirects to localhost after production signin:**
- ✅ Verify production URL is in Supabase redirect URLs list
- ✅ Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set to production domain in Vercel
- ✅ Clear browser cache and test in incognito mode
- ✅ Redeploy after making Vercel environment variable changes

**Payment webhooks not working:**
- ✅ Update Lemon Squeezy webhook URL to production domain
- ✅ Verify `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Lemon Squeezy dashboard
- ✅ Check Vercel function logs for webhook errors

## 🎯 How It Works

### Standard Launch Flow
1. User submits AI project (chooses "Standard Launch")
2. Project created with `status: "pending"` and `scheduled_launch: true`
3. Competition slot count incremented immediately
4. Admin approves → Goes live with nofollow link
5. Lives on homepage for 7 days
6. Participates in weekly voting
7. **Top 3 winners** → Automatically get dofollow backlink + badge

### Premium Launch Flow
1. User fills out complete submission form (chooses "Premium Launch")
2. Project created as **draft** with `status: "draft"` and `scheduled_launch: false`
3. Draft does NOT count toward competition slots yet
4. User proceeds to payment ($15 via LemonSqueezy)
5. **If payment succeeds:**
   - Webhook updates project: `status: "pending"`, `scheduled_launch: true`, `payment_status: true`
   - Competition slot count incremented
   - Enters admin approval queue
   - Upon approval → **Guaranteed dofollow backlink by default**
6. **If payment fails/cancelled:**
   - Draft remains in user's dashboard
   - User can resume draft later, modify details, or switch to Standard plan
   - Can resubmit with same details (old draft auto-deleted)
7. Can still compete for top 3 ranking and earn badges

### Weekly Competition (Automated)
- **Automatically starts every Monday at 00:00 PST (08:00 UTC)**
- **Automatically ends the following Monday at 23:59:59 PST (07:59:59 UTC)**
- Top 3 submissions with most votes win (both Standard and Premium)
- Winners get dofollow backlinks + badges automatically
- System creates 8 weeks of competitions in advance
- Cron job runs every hour to:
  - Create upcoming competitions
  - Activate competitions when Monday arrives
  - Complete competitions when they end
  - Award winners automatically

### Auto User Creation
When users sign in for the first time:
- User record automatically created in `users` table
- Profile data synced from OAuth provider
- Stats initialized (submissions: 0, votes: 0)

## 🛡️ Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies enabled:
- Users can only modify their own data
- Admins have full access
- Public can read approved content

### Authentication
- Secure token-based authentication
- HTTP-only cookies
- Automatic token refresh
- Session management

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
pnpm db:test
```

This will show detailed diagnostics and verify all tables are accessible.

### Authentication Issues

#### Email Magic Link Not Working

**Symptoms**: Email not arriving or link doesn't work
- ✅ Check spam/junk folder
- ✅ Verify "Email" provider is enabled in Supabase → Authentication → Providers
- ✅ Check email templates in Supabase (Authentication → Email Templates)
- ✅ Review Supabase Auth logs (Authentication → Logs) for errors
- ✅ Ensure Site URL is correctly set in Supabase


#### Google OAuth: "redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Solutions**:
- Ensure authorized redirect URI in Google Console matches: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Check that Supabase Site URL is correctly configured
- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Google OAuth redirect uses Supabase URL, not your app URL

#### "Invalid state parameter" Error

**Solutions**:
- Clear browser cookies for localhost
- Restart development server
- Try in incognito/private window
- Check that NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL matches your current environment

#### OAuth Redirects to Localhost in Production

**Symptoms**: After signing in on production, you're redirected back to `localhost:3000` instead of your production domain.

**Root Cause**: Supabase rejects unauthorized redirect URLs and falls back to the first allowed URL (localhost).

**Solutions**:
1. **Configure Supabase Redirect URLs** (⚠️ CRITICAL FIX):
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Set **Site URL** to: `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Add these to **Redirect URLs**:
     - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`
     - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback/**`
     - `https://yourdomain.com/**`
   - Click **Save**

2. **Verify Vercel Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set to `https://yourdomain.com` for Production
   - Redeploy after making changes

3. **Clear Cache**:
   - Wait 2-3 minutes after saving Supabase settings
   - Clear browser cache or use incognito mode
   - Test authentication flow again

#### OAuth Works in Dev but Not Production

**Solutions**:
- Create **separate** OAuth Apps for production (recommended)
- Use different Client ID and Secret for each environment
- Update Supabase redirect URLs to include production domain (see above)
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production domain in Vercel environment variables
- Verify production callback URLs in OAuth provider settings
- Ensure Supabase Site URL is set to production domain

### Debugging Tips

1. **Browser Console**: Check for detailed JavaScript errors (F12 → Console)
2. **Network Tab**: Inspect redirect URLs and API responses (F12 → Network)
3. **Server Logs**: Check terminal where `pnpm dev` is running
4. **Supabase Auth Logs**: Check Authentication → Logs in Supabase Dashboard
5. **Error Messages**: The sign-in page displays detailed error information

### Build Errors

```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Common Issues

**Port 3000 already in use**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
pnpm dev
```

**Environment variables not loading**:
- Restart development server after changing `.env.local`
- Verify variable names start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Check for typos in variable names

**Supabase connection timeout**:
- Check if Supabase project is paused (free tier pauses after 1 week of inactivity)
- Verify SUPABASE_URL and keys are correct
- Check internet connection

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

For detailed schema information, see `supabase/schema.sql`

Key features:
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) auto-managed
- Indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints
- RLS policies for security
