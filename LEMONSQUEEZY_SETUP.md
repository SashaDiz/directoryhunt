## How It Works

1. **Customer pays** ‚Üí LemonSqueezy processes payment
2. **Webhook fires** ‚Üí Your server records payment in database
3. **Modal appears** ‚Üí Customer sees confirmation with button
4. **Customer clicks button** ‚Üí Redirects to your platform
5. **Your platform detects payment** ‚Üí Shows success message and completes submission

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation**: The Button Link in Product Settings is STATIC (same for all orders). It cannot include dynamic parameters like `directoryId`.

‚úÖ **Solution**: When creating checkouts via API (which you're doing), the `product_options.redirect_url` we set in the code OVERRIDES this static button link and can include dynamic parameters.

So your current code implementation is already handling this correctly!

## What Each Field Does

- **Title**: First thing customers see after payment
- **Message**: Explains what happened and what to do next
- **Button Text**: Call-to-action text (keep it clear and actionable)
- **Button Link**: Where the button takes them (overridden by API when using `product_options.redirect_url`)

2. ‚úÖ Verify modal appears with correct text
3. ‚úÖ Click the button and confirm redirect works
4. ‚úÖ Check that payment is recorded in database
